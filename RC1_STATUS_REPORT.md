## What's Different About This RC1

### Traditional RC
- "Beta testing to find bugs"
- Focus on internal quality
- Fix everything before release

### TER RC1
- "Market validation to confirm positioning"
- Focus on external feedback (does this solve the right problem?)
- Code is already production-ready
- Documentation is already locked
- Messaging is already aligned
- Proof (reference deployment) is already built

**Goal**: Confirm that "environment contracts for infrastructure" resonates with early adopters.

## Key Learnings from This Session

### Strategic Pivot Works
- Reframed from library to platform: ✅ Clear
- Identified right buyer (platform teams): ✅ Clear
- Built proof (reference deployment): ✅ Convincing
- Locked scope (V1_SCOPE.md): ✅ Boundaries defined

### Code Was Always Ready
- 348+ tests passing: ✅ Solid
- Zero dependencies: ✅ Enterprise-safe
- 3 SDKs identical behavior: ✅ Portable
- No feature gaps for v1.0: ✅ Complete

### Documentation Alignment Matters
- 9 positioning docs + reference: ✅ Coherent story
- Messaging consistency across docs: ✅ No contradictions
- Clear delineation v1.0 vs v1.1: ✅ Boundary discipline

### Proof Trumps Marketing
- Reference deployment > 100 slides
- Real CI/CD workflow > aspirational claims
- Working example > feature checklist

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Early adopters don't test it
**Mitigation**: Make it super easy (5-minute tutorial, reference deployment already included)

### Risk: Reference deployment doesn't work for them
**Mitigation**: Included complete CI/CD example, multi-environment support, audit trails

### Risk: Positioning doesn't resonate
**Mitigation**: Backed by formal spec, proven with reference deployment, clear scope lock

### Risk: SDK inconsistency found
**Mitigation**: 348+ tests verify consistency, but we monitor for edge cases

### Risk: No RC1 feedback
**Mitigation**: Outreach to specific early adopters (not public announcement yet)
